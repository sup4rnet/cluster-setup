BUGS:
- need to recompile the driver on rest-bf02 switch

VM AUTOMATION

- add logic to remove/rename vm through Ansible (need to delete qcow2 file)
- check libvirt-define.yaml file if according to best practices for copying VM disk from base image
- check if P4 Studio is installed (or install otehrwise) in bootstrap role
- DHCP server / netplan IP addresses integrated with ansible 

P4:

- service runs as root ...why? ssh keys should be geenrated for root...
